# Build Ai Agents - Complete Learning Journey

A comprehensive end-to-end tutorial series covering the complete lifecycle of building, deploying, and monitoring AI agents using modern GenAI frameworks.

## 🎯 Learning Path

### 📚 **1. LangGraph Introduction**
Learn the fundamentals of **LangGraph** - a powerful framework for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs. Master concepts like:
- Graph-based agent architectures
- State management and message flow
- Tool calling and conditional routing
- Building custom agent workflows

### 🧠 **2. Knowledge Assistant**
Build intelligent **knowledge retrieval systems** that can:
- Query vector databases and document stores
- Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Create context-aware responses
- Handle complex information retrieval tasks

### 🔧 **3. MLflow Integration for GenAI Apps**
Integrate **MLflow** for production-ready AI applications:
- Model lifecycle management
- Experiment tracking and versioning
- ResponsesAgent integration
- Production model serving

### 🚀 **4. End-to-End Project**
Combine all concepts into a **complete AI agent system**:
- Multi-tool agent architecture
- Real-world business logic integration
- Complex workflow orchestration
- Production-ready implementation

### 🌐 **5. Deploy GenAI App as Web App**
Deploy your AI agents using **Databricks Apps**:
- Streamlit-based chat interfaces
- Real-time streaming responses
- User feedback collection
- Custom UI and branding

### 📊 **6. Evaluation & Monitoring**
Implement comprehensive **evaluation and monitoring**:
- MLflow evaluation harness
- Quality metrics and LLM judges
- Performance monitoring
- Continuous improvement workflows

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **LangGraph** - Agent framework
